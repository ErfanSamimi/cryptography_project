# DES Cryptanalysis and Implementation

## Description

This project was developed as part of a University Academic Project. It implements the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm for both encryption and decryption, with explicit handling of DES components such as initial permutation, S-boxes, P-boxes, and key scheduling. Additionally, it includes a cryptanalysis task to deduce a non-standard straight P-box from observed plaintext-ciphertext pairs and decrypt messages accordingly.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Implementation of the DES algorithm, including manual construction of permutation and substitution steps.
- Analysis and reverse engineering of cryptographic primitives (P-box) from known plaintext-ciphertext pairs.
- Application of bitwise operations, permutations, and binary encoding/decoding.
- Practice in cryptanalysis techniques relevant to symmetric-key algorithms.
- Design and testing of software for secure data transformation and recovery.

**Summary:** This project provided hands-on experience in cryptographic algorithm implementation and cryptanalysis, focusing on DES internals and practical attack scenarios.
